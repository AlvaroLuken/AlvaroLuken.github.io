I have been meaning to use Github Pages to launch my personal website for a while. As a Christmas present to myself, I am executing this decision tonight! Hoping to post a lot of my mindless dribble, my interests and quirks and anything that might relay positivity throughout this world on this website. Cheers to a 2019 full of work and creativity!
