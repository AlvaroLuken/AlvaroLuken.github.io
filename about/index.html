		<div class="about">
			<h1>Aloha.</h1>
			<p> My name is Alvaro Luken Luna. People call me Al for short. I am a full-time student at New York University.<p>
      <p> I study computer science, though I like to call it software engineering. I am minoring in history as well - notably history of science and anything to do with the American Revolution. </br>
Quite passionate about theatre and always down to attend a play or a musical. I play a few instruments and am ALWAYS ready to jam out. </br>
