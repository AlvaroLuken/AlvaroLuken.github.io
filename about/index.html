			<h1>Welcome, fellow life form.</h1>
			<div class="intro">
			My name is Alvaro Luken Luna. People call me Al for short. I am a full-time student at New York University.
      I study computer science, though I like to call it software engineering. I am minoring in history as well - notably history of science and anything to do with the American Revolution.
      Quite passionate about theatre and always down to attend a play or a musical. I play a few instruments and am ALWAYS ready to jam. </br>
